#This is the configuration file for the DFiant Remote (DFR) utility.
#DFR enables running various programs remotely in dedicated cloud nodes.

#Session settings
#----------------
session:
  #Session timeout in hours
  #Default = 8
  timeout_hours: 8

#Remote Control settings
#-----------------------
remote_control:
  #The protocol of the remote control
  #Use `rdp` for RDP protocol. By default, DFR will invoke an RDP client according to your OS.
  #Use `vnc` for VNC protocol. By default, DFR will invoke your default browser for control.
  #Use `off` to disable remote control.
  #Notes:
  #The RDP route supports clipboard copy-paste between the remote and local machines.
  #The VNC route does not currently support clipboard copy-paste between the remote and local machines.
  #Default = rdp
  protocol: rdp

#Sync settings
#-------------
sync:
  #Filter of synchronized files from the local folder to the remote node folder.
  #The filter setting can use combination inclusion/exclusion filter string settings.
  #Use `i <filter>` string to include the path files that match the filter pattern.
  #Use `e <filter>` string to exclude the path files that match the filter pattern.
  #DFR uses rclone for synchronizing, and the filter pattern is documented at:
  #https://rclone.org/filtering/#pattern-syntax 
  filter_to_remote: [
    # Common config sources
    i *.json,

#Port forwarding settings
#------------------------
#Some applications may require additional ports forwarded so your local machine
#can connect to the remote running application as if it was running locally.
#For example, you may want to use a remote JTag programming software with a 
#locally connected hardware.

  tcp: [
    #3121, #default Xilinx HW Server port 
  ]
  udp: [

  ]


#Tool version settings
#---------------------
#The tool versions we expect the remote node to support for this folder.
#The format in which we specify the versions is:
#<tool_domain>:
#   <tool_vendor>:
#       <tool_name>: <tool_version>
#If the tool is not specified, then it won't be available.
#The tool version can be: 
# * A specific version release string
# * For version controlled repo, a tag string or a full commit hash
# * 'latest[:VERSION]' for the latest stable/experimental supported release or tag.
#   Without an explicit version, DFR will look for the latest and then update the config file.
#   With an explicit version, that version will be set. 
#   We can run DFR to update this latest version automatically via `dfr tools update`
#For a complete list of supported tools, domains, and vendors see:
